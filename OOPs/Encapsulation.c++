//The process of grouping data members and corresponding methods into a single unit is known as Encapsulation. It is an important part of object-oriented programming. We can create a fully encapsulated class by making all the data members private. If the data members are private, it can only be accessible within the class; no other class can access that classâ€™s data members.
